# FDA Medical Device Intelligence Demo

## What This Demo Is

This application demonstrates a prototype FDA Medical Device Intelligence system that:

- **Queries the openFDA API** for medical device-related data
- **Provides AI-enhanced analysis** of regulatory activities, safety events, and compliance information
- **Supports dual-perspective searching** by intelligently determining if your query is for a device or manufacturer
- **Visualizes regulatory data streams** from multiple FDA databases including:
  - 510(k) clearance submissions
  - Pre-Market Approval (PMA) applications
  - Adverse event reports
  - Recall notices
  - Device classification records
  - Unique Device Identifier (UDI) database entries

## What This Demo Isn't

- **Not a comprehensive regulatory tool** - displays only sample data (typically 5 records per section)
- **Not a clinical decision support system** - insights are for demonstration purposes only
- **Not an official FDA resource** - uses public API data but applies experimental AI analysis
- **Not a substitute for professional regulatory intelligence** - analysis is illustrative of possibilities
- **Not guaranteed to show the most recent data** - API queries are limited by design

## Technical Workflow

1. **Query Classification**
   - User enters a search term
   - LLM determines if the query is a device type or manufacturer name
   - Search context is optimized based on classification

2. **Data Retrieval**
   - Application queries multiple openFDA endpoints
   - Results are cached to improve performance
   - Data is structured into device-centric or manufacturer-centric views

3. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**
   - Sample datasets are prepared for LLM processing
   - Custom prompts are generated based on data type and query context
   - AI generates insights while acknowledging data limitations
   - Analysis focuses on patterns, trends, and regulatory implications

4. **Interactive Presentation**
   - Results are organized by data type (recalls, events, clearances, etc.)
   - AI insights are displayed prominently with raw data available in expandable sections
   - Interface adapts based on query type and available data

## Use Cases

- Quick assessment of a device type's regulatory history
- Overview of a manufacturer's recent FDA interactions
- Identification of potential safety signals (with the caveat of limited sampling)
- Comparative view of different regulatory pathways for similar devices

## Data Sources

All data is retrieved directly from the [openFDA API](https://open.fda.gov/apis/), which provides access to:
- Device 510(k) Clearance Database
- Device Adverse Event Reports
- Device Recalls
- Device Classification Database
- Device Pre-Market Approvals
- Unique Device Identification Database

## Important Disclaimers

- This is a demonstration application only
- Analysis is performed on small data samples
- Insights should be considered illustrative, not definitive
- No clinical or regulatory decisions should be based on this demo
- For authoritative information, consult official FDA resources
